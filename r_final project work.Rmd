# Effect on Batting Average

MLB batting average is a metric that shows how often players are recording hits per at-bat. It divides a player's total hits by their total at bats. Therefore, the formula is  $$BA=\frac{H}{AB},$$ where H denotes hits and AB denotes at-bats.

```{r eval=FALSE}
df <- read.csv('torpedo_bat.csv')
N <- length(df$Player)
ba <- df$BA
x <- df$Year

code <- nimbleCode({
  b0 ~ dunif(0,1)
  b1 ~ dunif(0,0.5) ## mostly uninformative prior with some knowledge about the range of believable batting averages
  sigma ~ dunif(0,10000)
  for(i in 1:N){
    mu[i] <- b0+b1*ba[i]*x[i]
    eps[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i],sd=sigma)
    logit(p[i]) <- mu[i]+eps[i]
  }
})

constants <- list(N=N)
data <- list(ba=ba,x=x)
inits <- list(b0=0,b1=0.242,sigma=1,eps=rep(0,N)) ## 0.242 is the league average for batting average as of 5/2

Rmodel <- nimbleModel(code,constants,data,inits)
conf <- configureMCMC(Rmodel)
Rmcmc <- buildMCMC(conf)

Cmodel <- compileNimble(Rmodel)
Cmcmc <- compileNimble(Rmcmc)

samples <- runMCMC(Cmcmc,niter=20000,nburnin=5000)
```

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
save(samples,file='samples1_final.Rdata')
```

```{r echo=FALSE}

```

```
The current league batting average is $0.242$ and the batting average for hitters with the torpedo bat is about $0.250$. Therefore, on average, torpedo bat users are hitting roughly $0.008$ above the league average, meaning they are recording hits $0.8\%$ more often. 

# Effect on On-Base Percentage

MLB on-base percentage is a metric that measures how often players get on base. It divides the amount of times a player reaches base by their total plate appearances. Therefore, the formula is $$OBP=\frac{H+BB+HBP}{AB+BB+HBP+SF},$$, where H represents hits, BB represents walks, HBP represents hit-by-pitches, AB represents at-bats, and SF represents sacrifice flies.

```{r eval=FALSE}
obp <- df$OBP

code <- nimbleCode({
  b0 ~ dunif(0,1)
  b1 ~ dunif(0.1,0.5) # mostly uninformative prior with some knowledge of believable on-base percentages 
  sigma ~ dunif(0,10000)
  for(i in 1:N){
    mu[i] <- b0+b1*obp[i]*x[i]
    eps[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i],sd=sigma)
    logit(p[i]) <- mu[i]+eps[i]
  }
})

constants <- list(N=N)
data <- list(obp=obp,x=x)
inits <- list(b0=0,b1=0.316,sigma=1,eps=rep(0,N)) ## 0.316 is the league average on-base percentage as of 5/2

Rmodel <- nimbleModel(code,constants,data,inits)
conf <- configureMCMC(Rmodel)
Rmcmc <- buildMCMC(conf)

Cmodel <- compileNimble(Rmodel)
Cmcmc <- compileNimble(Rmcmc)

samples <- runMCMC(Cmcmc,niter=20000,nburnin=5000)
```

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
save(samples,file='samples2_final.Rdata')
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
load('samples2_final.Rdata')
```

```{r}
MCMCtrace(samples,params='b1',pdf=FALSE)
effectiveSize(samples)
samplesSummary(samples)
```
The current league on-base percentage is $0.316$, and the on-base percentage for hitters using torpedo bats is about $0.300$. Therefore, on average, hitters using the torpedo bats are getting on base roughly $0.016$ below the league average, meaning they are getting on base $1.6\%$ less often.

# Effect on Slugging Percentage

MLB slugging percentage is a metric that measures a player's batting "power" when it comes to hitting. It calculates a player's total bases resulting from hits divided by their total at-bats. Therefore, the formula is $$SLG=\frac{1B+2*2B+3*3B+4*HR}{AB},$$ where $1B$ denotes singles, $2B$ denotes doubles, $3B$ denotes triples, and HR denotes home runs.

```{r eval=FALSE}
slg <- df$SLG

code <- nimbleCode({
  b0 ~ dunif(0,1)
  b1 ~ dunif(0.2,0.6) # mostly uninformative prior with some knowledge of believable slugging percentages 
  sigma ~ dunif(0,10000)
  for(i in 1:N){
    mu[i] <- b0+b1*slg[i]*x[i]
    eps[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i],sd=sigma)
    logit(p[i]) <- mu[i]+eps[i]
  }
})

constants <- list(N=N)
data <- list(slg=slg,x=x)
inits <- list(b0=0,b1=0.391,sigma=1,eps=rep(0,N)) ## 0.391 is the league average slugging percentage as of 5/2

Rmodel <- nimbleModel(code,constants,data,inits)
conf <- configureMCMC(Rmodel)
Rmcmc <- buildMCMC(conf)

Cmodel <- compileNimble(Rmodel)
Cmcmc <- compileNimble(Rmcmc)

samples <- runMCMC(Cmcmc,niter=20000,nburnin=5000)
```

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
save(samples,file='samples3_final.Rdata')
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
load('samples3_final.Rdata')
```

```{r}
MCMCtrace(samples,params='b1',pdf=FALSE)
effectiveSize(samples)
samplesSummary(samples)
```
The league average slugging percentage is $0.391$ and the average slugging percentage for hitters using the torpedo bat is about $0.400$. Therefore, hitters using the torpedo bat are slugging $0.009$ above the league average.
