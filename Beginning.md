# my-stuff
Hi! My name is Noah Seaner, a graduate of Lafayette College's class of 2025. I hold a dual Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and German, a minor in data science, and a concentration in statistics. As an aspiring data analyst, I love looking at how trends influence the world and aid in decision-making. Over the course of my college career, I have taken lots of courses, participated in programs, and had other experiences in data analysis. I have learned how to take raw data and transform it into meaningful insight. All of the projects that I have worked on can be found in this repository in the form of Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, Tableau dashboards, and R Studio files.
